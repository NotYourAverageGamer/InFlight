# InFlight 3.3.5

InFlight is a simple taxi flight timer addon that tells you how long it will take to get to your destination.

Other addons may provide a similar feature, however, InFlight is a lightweight alternative that, in most cases, is leaner, faster and uses a lot less memory (which is the main motivation behind InFlight).

## Features

- Many customization options for the look of the timer bar
- Support for Druid-only and some other special flight paths
- Already has most flight times
- Learns new flight times or updates existing flight times when taxis are used
- Flight times added to tooltip on flight map

## How to Use

- InFlight is LoadOnDemand to use less memory when not needed
- `/inflight`, right-click on the timer bar, or check interface options to customise
- `Shift+left-click` and drag to move the timer bar
