# InFlight 3.3.5

InFlight is a simple taxi flight timer addon that tells you how long it will take to get to your destination.

Other addons may provide a similar feature, however, InFlight is a lightweight alternative that, in most cases, is leaner, faster and uses a lot less memory (which is the main motivation behind InFlight).

## Features

- InFlight is LoadOnDemand to use less memory when not needed
- Many customization options for the look of the timer bar
- Support for Druid-only and some other special flight paths
- Already has most flight times
- Learns new flight times or updates existing flight times when taxis are used
- Flight times added to tooltip on flight map

## How to Install

- [Download](https://github.com/NotYourAverageGamer/InFlight-3.3.5/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the `.zip`
- Extract both `InFlight` and `InFlight_Load` to your Addons folder (`resources\client\Interface\AddOns`)

## How to Use

- `Shift+left-click` and drag to move the timer bar
- To customise the appearance do one of the following
    - Type `/inflight`
    - `Right-Click` on the timer bar *(if showing)*
    - Or, check `Esc -> Interface -> Addons`
